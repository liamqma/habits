# habits

A completely free service which help build good habits and break bad ones

## Why do I build this

I know that 'divide and conquer' is best way to develop habits. New year resolution is wishful thinking. I need to set daily, weekly and monthly targets. Therefore, I need a Web/Native app as a reminder and results-checker. All the services I found are either poorly designed or paid. Hence, I've decided to build it.

## Usage

TBD

## Development

```
$ touch src/config.json

# Fill in config.json
{
    "apiKey": "xxx",
    "authDomain": "xxx.firebaseapp.com",
    "databaseURL": "https://xxx.firebaseio.com",
    "projectId": "xxx",
    "storageBucket": "xxx",
    "messagingSenderId": "xxx",
    "appId": "xxx",
    "measurementId": "xxx"
}

$ npm install

$ npm start
```
