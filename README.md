# Habits

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liamqma/habits.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liamqma/habits)

A completely free service which help build good habits and break bad ones

## Why do I build this

I know that 'divide and conquer' is best way to develop habits. New year resolution is wishful thinking. I need to set daily, weekly and monthly targets. Therefore, I need a Web/Native app as a reminder and results-checker. All the services I found are either poorly designed or paid. Hence, I've decided to build it.

## Usage
